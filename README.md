# Predicting Company Bankruptcy using Supervised & Unsupervised Learning Models
Welcome to the Company Bankruptcy Repository! This repository is a AI Tools project that I've worked on with [Vincenzo Bean] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincenzobean/) during my sophomore year at the Milwaukee School of Engineering!

## Project Description
The aim of this project is to develop different supervised and unsuperivsed machine learning models that look at a company's financial data and predict if the company is heading towards bankruptcy or not. The models used are K-Nearest Neighbors, KMeans and Artificial Neural Networks.

### Information on the Dataset
This dataset is designed about for predicting bankruptcy in American Public Companies that are listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ. It includes financial data from from 8,262 companies, covering the years 1999 to 2018. 

### Hypothesis Questions
Before we built our model and tested them on the bankruptcy dataset, we developed a few hypothesis questions as such:
1. How well can a KNN accuratly predict if a company will go bankrupt using only the current assests and the net sales of the company?
2. How well can a K means clustering algorithm group bankrupted and non bankrupted companies using the entire chosen data set.
3. What is the predictive accuracy of an artificial neural network in identifying bankruptcy risk in American Public Companies using historical financial data?
